# PSYC 1101 CoCo Demo

## Abstract
The Müller-Lyer illusion, where identical lines appear unequal, has been observed in humans and many other species. As deep neural networks (DNNs) become models of biological vision, they offer a way to probe perceptual biases in machines. In this demo, we will explore whether state-of-the-art DNNs like ChatGPT also “perceive” the Müller-Lyer illusion. By comparing human and machine perception, we aim to understand what visual illusions reveal about intelligence.
